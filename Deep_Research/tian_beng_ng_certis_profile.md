# Stakeholder Analysis: Tian Beng Ng in relation to Certis (as of Fri Nov 21, 2025)

## Verification and timestamped identity disambiguation

As of Fri Nov 21, 2025, there is no confirmed primary-source evidence that an individual named “Tian Beng Ng” (also rendered “Ng Tian Beng”) currently holds any role at Certis or serves on a Certis board or executive committee. A thorough check against Certis’s leadership page, newsroom and press releases, and sustainability/annual reporting reveals no listing or announcement of a Certis appointment for this name, nor any biographical entry or mention that would substantiate a current position at Certis [1][2][3] (accessed 21 Nov 2025). Searches of reputable Singapore media outlets similarly do not surface a verified linkage between “Tian Beng Ng” and a Certis leadership or governance role as of the same date [6][7][8] (accessed 21 Nov 2025). Regulatory/biz registry direction-of-travel checks indicate no publicly visible ACRA record tying the name to a Certis legal entity directorship; however, ACRA access is constrained without a targeted entity search and official extracts, so this remains open for direct confirmation [4] (accessed 21 Nov 2025).

Disambiguation is required because “Ng Tian Beng” is a well-known Singapore-based technology executive at Dell/Dell Technologies with long-tenured Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) leadership roles. That public profile appears in Dell’s newsroom and is widely referenced in industry reporting, but there is no primary-source indication that this Dell executive currently holds or recently held a role at Certis [9] (accessed 21 Nov 2025). The Certis company page on LinkedIn does not, as of the access date, provide a corroborating employee listing or announcement connecting “Ng Tian Beng” to Certis in a leadership capacity; a person-level LinkedIn profile link specific to Certis could not be confirmed and therefore remains open for verification [5] (accessed 21 Nov 2025).

Conclusion of verification: The association between “Tian Beng Ng/Ng Tian Beng” and Certis is unconfirmed as of 21 Nov 2025. All role-specific assertions in this report are therefore clearly labeled as Confirmed (none), Inferred (scenario-based implications should he be a Certis leader or director), or Open (requires primary-source proof). Where potential identity overlap with the Dell executive may be suspected, those references are explicitly flagged as Disambiguation/Inferred and not attributed to Certis without further evidence [1][2][3][5][6][7][8][9] (all accessed 21 Nov 2025).

## Method and evidence standard

Primary sources were prioritized: Certis corporate leadership and governance pages, official press releases, and sustainability/annual reports [1][2][3], along with statutory/regulatory channels for director appointments [4], and the subject’s own LinkedIn profile if available [5]. Secondary media sources used strictly for corroboration were The Straits Times, The Business Times, and Channel NewsAsia [6][7][8]. For identity disambiguation, Dell Technologies’ newsroom and executive materials were referenced [9]. For IBM relevance and proof points, IBM’s case study library was used [10]. Access date for all sources cited in this report is 21 Nov 2025.

Discrepancy protocol: Where LinkedIn and corporate sites disagree, the most recent dated primary corporate disclosure prevails. Any absence on Certis’s leadership and newsroom pages is treated as non-confirmation rather than negative proof; in such cases, the item remains Open and requires direct validation with Certis Corporate Communications or official filings [1][2][3][4].

## Certis corporate context and market dynamics

Certis, a Temasek-owned company headquartered in Singapore, operates across integrated security, ops-tech and facilities services, with material operations in Singapore and parts of Asia-Pacific, including Australia and North Asia. The company is known for aviation security, intelligent traffic enforcement, integrated command-and-control operations, and the convergence of physical security with data-driven digital platforms [1][2][3]. In recent years, the company narrative emphasizes outcome-based service models, digital transformation of security and operations, and workforce modernization amid labor constraints [1][3].

Four dynamics shape near-term priorities. First, workforce transformation is central: labor-market tightness, progressive wage requirements and the cost of 24×7 operations drive adoption of automation, advanced rostering, and AI-enabled assistance to sustain SLAs while maintaining margins [1][3]. Second, safety, security and resilience needs are widening, especially in aviation, public sector and critical infrastructure, necessitating modernized SOCs and integrated command centers with robust incident triage and response playbooks [1][2]. Third, customer SLAs and experience are increasingly outcome-based, requiring real-time visibility, predictive analytics, and orchestrated field operations to mitigate liquidated damages and protect CSAT and renewals [1][3]. Fourth, digital and data modernization across the ops-tech stack is critical: consolidating point solutions into interoperable platforms, governing data for AI/ML, and securing cyber-physical estates across IT/OT/IoT boundaries [1][3].

## Career trajectory of “Tian Beng Ng” (Confirmed vs Inferred)

There is no confirmed Certis role, title or biography for “Tian Beng Ng/Ng Tian Beng” on Certis primary sources as of 21 Nov 2025 [1][2][3]. Consequently, no Certis-linked career entries can be asserted as Confirmed. 

A distinguished executive with the same name is widely recognized within Dell/Dell Technologies, historically associated with APJ channel and regional leadership roles and often cited in APJ partner ecosystem contexts [9]. This disambiguated identity is Inferred for context only and is not linked to Certis in this report. Without a primary-source LinkedIn profile explicitly connecting this person to Certis, any transfer of accomplishments, dates, or responsibilities from Dell to Certis would be inappropriate [5][9].

Open items to verify include whether there is any Certis appointment, start date, remit and reporting line for the named individual, as well as education, prior roles, and board/committee memberships. These require either a Certis official source, the subject’s LinkedIn profile with recency signals, or a reputable media announcement [1][2][3][5][6][7][8].

## Key achievements with measurable outcomes/KPIs

No achievements can be attributed to a Certis role for “Tian Beng Ng” at this time because no Certis position is confirmed [1][2][3]. If a Certis role is later validated, the appropriate achievements to collect would include P&L and margin outcomes tied to transformation programs; SLA and incident-response metrics in operations; adoption and accuracy metrics for AI/computer vision; workforce productivity and overtime reductions; asset uptime and mean time to restoration; and customer outcomes such as renewals, new logos and NPS/CSAT improvements [1][2][3]. Any references to the Dell executive’s partner ecosystem growth or APJ outcomes are not relevant to Certis unless a formal linkage is proven [9].

## Current strategic goals and near-term priorities (contextualized to Certis)

If the named individual holds a Certis leadership or board role, the near-term priorities would logically align to Certis’s integrated ops-tech strategy and market conditions. Platformization of security and facilities operations into an integrated, data-centric stack would be expected, including real-time command-center orchestration and open APIs for ecosystem extensibility [1][3]. Workforce augmentation would be a near-term imperative, scaling intelligent rostering, mobile workflows, and AI-enabled decision support for supervisors and frontline officers to sustain SLAs against labor constraints [1][3]. Cyber-physical convergence—bringing IT, OT and IoT security under a unified risk and operations model—would be integral for aviation, transport and critical infrastructure clients [1][2][3]. The commercial focus would likely emphasize outcome-based contracts and predictive operations to protect margins and reduce liquidated damages, supported by robust telemetry and governance [1][3]. Expansion in priority segments and geographies (notably aviation and public sector in Singapore, as well as Australia and North Asia) would continue to build managed service annuities in line with Certis’s model [1][2][3]. These scenario-based goals should be assigned to the named individual only if a Certis role is confirmed.

## Principal challenges and risks

The most salient risks for a Certis leader include labor and cost pressures, technology-integration complexity, and tight SLA regimes. Labor-related risks span recruiting and retaining licensed officers, adapting to progressive wage models, and managing training and fatigue in 24×7 rosters; together these can erode margins and threaten SLA reliability. Technology integration debt from legacy systems and vendor sprawl can slow transformation, while AI/computer vision performance variability across environments introduces operational and reputational risks if not governed carefully. Contractual exposure is material in outcome-based engagements, where telemetry gaps or operational disruptions can translate to liquidated damages and renewal risk. Cyber-physical threats animate converged IT/OT/IoT attack surfaces and require strong governance across data privacy and safety-by-design. Competitive dynamics include local and regional security providers, global and niche technology integrators, and hyperscaler-led solution stacks. Finally, capital discipline poses timing and scale constraints on automation and platform investments, particularly in private-company contexts where cash flow and return thresholds are tightly managed [1][2][3].

Summary mapping of risk causes to impacts and mitigations:

| Risk cause | Primary impact on Certis operations | Practical mitigation path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tight labor markets and progressive wage requirements | Higher cost-to-serve, SLA volatility, fatigue and safety risks | AI-assisted rostering, mobile workflows, targeted automation, training analytics, outcome-based pricing |
| Legacy systems and vendor sprawl | Integration delays, data silos, inconsistent analytics and AI quality | Platform consolidation, open APIs, data governance for AI/ML, staged migration patterns |
| Outcome-based SLAs with LD exposure | Revenue leakage, margin compression, renewal risk | Real-time SLA telemetry, predictive operations, playbook automation, proactive exception management |
| Cyber-physical convergence and regulatory scrutiny | Safety/security incidents, compliance breaches | Unified SOC for IT/OT/IoT, zero-trust at the edge, secure MLOps, privacy-by-design |
| Competitive intensity and buyer consolidation | Price pressure, higher bar for differentiation | Solution differentiation via ops-tech platforms, ROI-backed pilots, reference architectures and proof points |

## Leadership style, decision-making approach and public positions

There is no primary-source evidence to assess the leadership style or public positions of “Tian Beng Ng” within Certis as of 21 Nov 2025 [1][2][3][6][7][8]. If the individual is the Dell executive of the same name, public remarks over time often emphasized ecosystem-led growth and disciplined partner execution, but such characterizations must not be ascribed to a Certis role absent primary confirmation. No direct quotes attributable to the subject in a Certis context were identified on the access date, and this remains open for future confirmation.

## Organizational influence map (scenario-based until a role is confirmed)

If the individual is a Certis executive with line responsibility, the role would typically report to the Group CEO or a regional CEO/CXO, with direct influence over BU general managers, program directors, command-center leaders and transformation office heads. Sponsorship would extend to platform modernization, workforce and SOC initiatives, with participation in executive, risk/compliance, transformation, tender and investment committees. Budget authority would likely be tiered with capex/opex thresholds aligned to the executive level, while buying centers would include security operations, command centers, IT/OT, data/AI and aviation operations, working through centralized procurement consistent with Singapore corporate governance norms [1][3].

If instead the person is a non-executive director, influence would be expressed through board committees—typically audit/risk, technology/transformation and remuneration—guiding strategy, major investments, risk posture and performance oversight. Day-to-day authority would be limited, but decisive influence would be exerted at gates for capital allocation, partnerships and technology platform commitments [1][3]. 

If there is no current Certis role, influence is indirect or non-existent, and outreach should pivot to the appropriate confirmed Certis decision maker(s) identified through the leadership page, press releases and relevant tenders [1][2][3].

## Relationships and engagements with IBM and competitors

There is no primary-source confirmation, as of 21 Nov 2025, of any active relationship or engagement between “Tian Beng Ng” and IBM in a Certis context [1][2][10]. More broadly, Certis’s operating context suggests a typical ecosystem spanning hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), video analytics/computer vision vendors, camera and edge OEMs, and systems integrators that deliver security and facilities-modernization programs. Competitive services integrators range from global consulting and technology firms to specialized regional and niche providers. Without a named role at Certis for “Tian Beng Ng,” no IBM or competitor engagement can be attributed to this stakeholder. This remains open pending either a Certis appointment confirmation or project-level disclosures on either Certis’s newsroom or partners’ case repositories [1][2][10].

## Implications for IBM Consulting

If the stakeholder is confirmed in a Certis leadership role, IBM should anchor engagement to four value pillars that map tightly to Certis’s ops-tech agenda. First, SOC and command-center modernization should integrate a unified data layer across security, FM and operations, using governed AI to enhance incident triage and response playbooks. Second, workforce transformation should target measurable SLA stability gains through intelligent rostering, mobile workflows and generative AI copilots for supervisors and officers. Third, cyber-physical convergence should be addressed through unified IT/OT/IoT risk management and zero-trust patterns at the edge, including secure MLOps for computer vision models. Fourth, outcome-based contract enablement should operationalize SLA telemetry and predictive analytics tied to commercial constructs, reducing LD exposure and reinforcing renewal narratives. IBM’s case-study library provides relevant proof points across public safety, transport, asset management and AI-enabled operations that can be curated to this context [10].

A prudent pilot strategy would concentrate on high-ROI use cases that prove value within 90–120 days: uplift accuracy for selected computer-vision use cases while preserving privacy; SOC playbook automation to compress MTTA/MTTR; workforce optimization to reduce overtime and improve shift coverage; and predictive maintenance for critical edge devices to raise uptime and reduce truck rolls. Success should be evidenced by double-digit improvements in targeted KPIs, with A/B baselines and acceptance criteria set upfront [10].

Stakeholder-specific messaging should be scenario-tailored. For a BU/operations executive, emphasize SLA reliability and response-time compression with quantified targets. For a technology/platform leader, focus on platform rationalization, data governance for AI, and integration-debt reduction. For a board/NED, stress staged pilots with quantified ROI, disciplined capex gating and compliance-by-design. In all cases, supplement messaging with curated references from IBM’s case library aligned to aviation, public sector and critical infrastructure operations [10].

## 30/60/90-day engagement plan with success metrics

Over the first 30 days, the priority is identity and remit confirmation. Seek direct verification of the stakeholder’s role through Certis Corporate Communications and confirm the operating model, SLAs and transformation backlog using primary sources and stakeholder interviews [1][2][3]. Concurrently, develop a current-state map of the command-center and field operations stack, including data flows and pain points, and shortlist one high-value use case with clear metrics and guardrails. Success at day 30 is a stakeholder-validated problem statement, a one-page value hypothesis with baseline measures, and an agreed pilot candidate.

Between days 31 and 60, co-design the pilot architecture, data contracts and security controls, and establish governance for AI/ML, privacy and change management. Build an ROI/TCO model aligned to Certis’s commercial constructs, including LD avoidance and SLA gains, and finalize acceptance criteria and measurement plans. Success at day 60 is a signed pilot charter, secured data access, sandbox readiness and a jointly owned KPI dashboard.

From days 61 to 90, implement the pilot, operate it in a controlled environment with A/B baselines and clear rollback plans, and track MTTA/MTTR, SLA adherence, model accuracy, overtime and uptime metrics depending on the use case. Deliver an executive readout with quantified outcomes, a scale-up roadmap and a risk-managed funding plan. Success at day 90 is a ≥15% improvement in the targeted KPI and a go/no-go decision with defined next-wave scope and benefits realization plan [10].
